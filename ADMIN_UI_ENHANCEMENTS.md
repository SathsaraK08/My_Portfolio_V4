## üéØ Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Subtle Scale Transforms**
- Hover: 3-5% size increase (1.03-1.05x)
- Tap: Slight reduction (0.95-0.97x)
- Avoids gimmicky exaggeration

### 2. **Color Intensity**
- Hover increases color saturation
- Smooth gradients for depth
- Theme-aware color schemes

### 3. **Performance First**
- CSS transforms over position changes
- Opacity transitions for fades
- Hardware-accelerated properties
- Minimal JavaScript animations

### 4. **Glassmorphism**
- Backdrop blur (blur-sm, blur-xl)
- Semi-transparent backgrounds (95% opacity)
- Layered depth with shadows

### 5. **Micro-interactions**
- Purposeful feedback for every action
- Smooth easing functions
- Spring physics for natural movement

### 6. **Professional Context**
- SaaS-appropriate styling
- Clean, uncluttered interfaces
- Accessible color contrasts
- Consistent spacing and rhythm
